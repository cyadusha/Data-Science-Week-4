Problem 1:
```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1,2,-1, 2,1,1, -3,-3,0), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
b <- matrix(c(5,13,-8), ncol = 1)
require('MASS')
giA <- ginv(A)
x <- giA%*%b #computes the cross product of the inverse matrix and the column vector 
x
```

Problem 2: 
```{r}
C <- matrix(c(4,-3,-3,5,0,1), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
D <- matrix(c(1,3,4,-2), ncol = 2)
y <- C%*%D
y
```
